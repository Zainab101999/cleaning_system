Acme systems is a world leader in providing software for hotel industry. Our customer Byford has requested us to create a system which allow the following:
1) Cleaning-staff: a person who has our app installed on their mobile phone, cleaning staff visits locations/room assigned to him and clean the room.
2) Supervisor: A person who verifies the work of cleaning staff.
3) Admin: A person who assigns location/ room to cleaning staff and assign supervisor at the same time.

Our requirement: The cleaning staff on starting their shift should login to the app and then visit room/location assigned to them by admin. They should start the timer when they start cleaning the room. After the cleaning is done they should fill the checklist with comments if any. Once done, they should submit the report and mark the task as complete. 

The supervisor should visit the rooms/locations assigned to them. They should pullout the details of the staff who cleaned the room. They verify the work and assign a rating for the cleaning.

The admin should allocate rooms to the cleaning staff and supervisor. 
Each cleaning staff and supervisor can service multiple rooms.
