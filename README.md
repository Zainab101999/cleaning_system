Our requirement: The cleaning staff on start of shift login to app and then visits room/location assigned to him by admin.He starts the timer while selecting the location. He does the cleaning and fills the checklist with comments if any. Once done, he submits the report and marks the task complete. 

The supervisor visits the rooms/locations assigned to him. He pullout the details of his staff who cleaned the location. He verifies the work and assigns a rate to each item. Once done, he finally rates the work.

The admin allocates rooms/ locations to cleaning staff and supervisor. 
Each cleaning staff and supervisor can service multiple locations/rooms.
